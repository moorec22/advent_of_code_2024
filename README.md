# advent_of_code_2024

My solutions to Advent of Code 2024!

To run:
* change code in main.go to reflect the day you would like to run
* execute `go run main.go` with the following flags:
  * -d X: required. X for the day you would like to run solutions for
  * -t: optional. If used, will run test.txt instead of input.txt
